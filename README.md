# ProjectEuler
From https://projecteuler.net/about, "Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems." 


These are my solutions to the problems that can be found at https://projecteuler.net/
Each script is designed to print the answer to the problem as a single line of output
